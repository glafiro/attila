![attila-preview](preview.png)

Attila is an open-source multiband distortion and bitcrushing plug-in. Within each band, you can completely tweak various parameters such as drive amount, drive knee and bit resolution, allowing you to create a wide range of effects—from the most wholesome 🤗♥ soft saturation ✨🥰 to full-on ear-piearcing sound demolition.

It is made with JUCE and it's available for Windows, MacOS and Linux in VST, AU and LV2 formats.
